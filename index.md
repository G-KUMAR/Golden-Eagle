## Welcome to Project Golden-Eagle

The Aim of this project is to develop a Drone system from scratch with the
capability of fully autonomous exploration in indoor scenarios and autonomous
object localization with retrieval . The constraint is to develop an economical
robust system with minimum sensor suite but complete autonomy . The gripping
capability of the Drone should not be limited to a particular shape and material
of the object while the design should also avoid a significant change in dynamics
of the system while operating.
 
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/G-KUMAR/Golden_Eagle.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
